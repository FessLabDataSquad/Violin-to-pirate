library(ggplot2) # This is a very powerful package for creating data visualizations. There are entire books written about this package.

# Here I create a custom function, largely based on gglot(). 

violin = function (X, Y) ggplot (X, aes(factor(prosocial_condition), Y)) + geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), aes(fill=condition)) + scale_fill_manual(values = c("olivedrab", "darkorange")) + xlab("Elevation is 1/Orange")  + theme(legend.position="none")

# Here I'm repeating the functiond defined in line 14, but spreading it out so I can add comments explaining it.
# You don't need to run both, but it just overwrites it with the same thing, so no big deal.

violin = function (X, Y) #we're creating a new function based on X and Y
  ggplot (X, aes(factor(prosocial_condition), Y)) +   # ggplot looks at dataframe X and plots variable Y split by prosocial_condition &...
  geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), aes(fill = condition)) +  # use the violin type plot, draw lines at the quartiles, color based on condition &...
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("olivedrab", "darkorange")) + # use these colors
  xlab("Elevation is 1/Orange")  + #label the X axis
  theme(legend.position = "none") # don't include a legend

# Your assignment is to improve this violin function to a pirate plot function, e.g.   https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-pirate-plot-2-0-the-rdi-plotting-choice-of-r-pirates/     or   https://sakaluk.wordpress.com/2017/02/03/15-make-it-pretty-diy-pirate-plots-in-ggplot2/

# Define your new function here:

pirate = function (...)



# Below is the long list of cases to be visualized this way. Check that your pirate function looks like it does the same thing, only better, than violin.
