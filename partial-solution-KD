# plug this function in and it produces pirate plots


pirate = function(K, D)
  pirateplot(formula = K ~ prosocial_condition,
             data = D,
             xlab = "Condition",
             ylab = "Dependent Variable", 
             main = "")
pirate (mturk1$elevating_emotions, mturk1)



# challenges remaining:

# (1) change the aesthetic attributes of the figure to match requirements:
#    a) formatting required by journal (e.g. black & white figures, fonts)
#    b) good solution for auto-labeling the axis
#              possible solution:
#                 ylab = name(K)   # and maybe add some text manipulation such that
#                                 text.manipulation (elevating_emotions) = Elevating Emotions
#
# (2) since the format for K and D are like
#    K = data$DV
#    D = data
# is there a way to just enter a single value K and derive D as a function of K?
#
# (3) generate a list of all Ks (or Ks and Ds) to feed to the custom function, probably with some *apply() function
